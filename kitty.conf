#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Fira Code Medium Nerd Font Complete Mono
bold_font        Fira Code Bold Nerd Font Complete Mono
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 11.0

#: Font size (in pts)

force_ltr no

#: kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say,
#: in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as
#: "WORLD HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word
#: ירושלים, selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם
#: actually writes into the selection buffer the character י.  kitty's
#: default behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse
#: the word order, however, if you wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it
#: can be very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to
#: turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the command
#: line program GNU FriBidi
#: <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable> to get BIDI
#: support, because it will force kitty to always treat the text as
#: LTR, which FriBidi expects for terminals.

# symbol_map

#: E.g. symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified Unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each Unicode code
#: point is specified in the form `U+<code point in hexadecimal>`. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. This option can be specified multiple times.
#: The syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# narrow_symbols

#: E.g. narrow_symbols U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 1

#: Usually, for Private Use Unicode characters and some symbol/dingbat
#: characters, if the character is followed by one or more spaces,
#: kitty will use those extra cells to render the character larger, if
#: the character in the font has a wide aspect ratio. Using this
#: option you can force kitty to restrict the specified code points to
#: render in the specified number of cells (defaulting to one cell).
#: This option can be specified multiple times. The syntax is::

#:     narrow_symbols codepoints [optionally the number of cells]

disable_ligatures never

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them. You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features option.

# font_features

#: E.g. font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code includes a discretionary feature,
#: zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the zero (0), to
#: make it more easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira Code also includes
#: other discretionary features known as Stylistic Sets which have the
#: tags ss01 through ss20.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: HarfBuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database
#: and then this option is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use `kitty +list-fonts
#: --psnames`:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     $ kitty +list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)

#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero in the bold font::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Bold +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# modify_font

#: Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. The modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. No
#: suffix means use pts. For example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. For example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

#: Note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the
#: underline and strikethrough positions by the same amount.
#: Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and
#: decreasing it lowers them. Decreasing the cell size might cause
#: rendering artifacts, so use with care.

box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: The sizes of the lines used for the box drawing Unicode characters.
#: These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to
#: arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to
#: thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#: Window layout {{{

remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  1024
initial_window_height 900

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 0.5pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor are
#: drawn. Note that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides
#: this and causes all borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges.

active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations yes

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this option when reloading config are undefined.

window_logo_path none

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG format. Relative paths are
#: interpreted relative to the kitty config directory. The logo is
#: displayed in a corner of every kitty window. The position is
#: controlled by window_logo_position. Individual windows can be
#: configured to have different logos either using the launch action
#: or the remote control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/> facility.

window_logo_position bottom-right

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: The time to wait before redrawing the screen when a resize event is
#: received (in seconds). On platforms such as macOS, where the
#: operating system sends events corresponding to the start and end of
#: a resize, this number is ignored.

resize_draw_strategy static

#: Choose how kitty draws a window while a resize is in progress. A
#: value of static means draw the current window contents, mostly
#: unchanged. A value of scale means draw the current window contents
#: scaled. A value of blank means draw a blank window. A value of size
#: means show the window size in cells.

resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the OS
#: window. Note that this does not currently work on Wayland.

visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The list of characters for visual window selection. For example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. The
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set [0-9A-Z]. Specify your preference as a
#: string of characters.

confirm_os_window_close -1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.
